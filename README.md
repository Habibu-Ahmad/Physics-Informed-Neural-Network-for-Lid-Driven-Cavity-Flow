# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for Lid-Driven Cavity Flow

**A mesh-free solver for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using deep learning**

## Overview
This project implements a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** to simulate 2D steady-state **lid-driven cavity flow**, a classic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) benchmark. The PINN solves the Navier-Stokes equations without traditional discretization methods using automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints.

**Key Features:**
- Solves incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for Ïˆ (stream function) and p (pressure)
- Enforces boundary conditions (no-slip walls, moving lid) via physics-informed loss
- Uses L-BFGS optimization for training
- Validates against Ghia et al.'s benchmark data (Re=100)
